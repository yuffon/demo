# Demo of RGSE

This project is about the demonstration of RGSE. 

RGSE is a regular property guided dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) engine, which can quickly find the program paths satisfying a regular property.

The file [manuel.pdf](https://github.com/jrgse/demo/raw/master/manuel.pdf) introduces how to run the test scripts.

The docker image of RGSE can be downloaded from [this link](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Amd07GCbYt_zbQZm2w2MBbXI6Zo).
